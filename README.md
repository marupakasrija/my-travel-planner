## 🧳 How to Use It

### 💬 The Chat Page

This is where the magic happens! Start by telling our AI about your dream vacation:

```plaintext
"I'm planning a trip to Tokyo for 5 days in April with my partner. We love food, technology, and traditional culture. Our budget is around $2000."
```

The AI will ask you questions to fill in missing details and craft a personalized itinerary. All your trip details appear on the right side of the screen.

### 🔍 The Search Page

Looking for specific attractions or activities? Use the search page to find cool places to add to your itinerary. Just type in something like:

```plaintext
"best sushi in Kyoto"
"family activities in Barcelona"
```

### ⚡ The Generator Page

In a hurry? Use the generator page to quickly fill out a form with your travel info and get a full itinerary — perfect when you already know your preferences.
